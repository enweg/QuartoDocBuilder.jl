# QuartoDocBuilder.jl

QuartoDocBuilder.jl is a package inspired by R [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). It provides an easy way to generate a website with documentation and vignettes, by creating a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) project.

Being powered by Quarto means that deploying to Github pages, customizing the style and many more things are taken for granted. This website doc even has a comment section! Check some examples [here](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#websites) and the complete list of options [here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html). 

The [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/) itself is written with Quarto! Check the github repo [here](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web) to get some inspiration.
