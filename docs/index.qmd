# QuartoDocBuilder.jl

QuartoDocBuilder.jl is a package inspired by R [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). It provides an easy way to generate a website with documentation and vignettes, by creating a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) project.

Being powered by Quarto means that deploying to Github pages, customizing the style and many more things are taken for granted. This website doc even has a comment section! Check some examples [here](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#websites) and the complete list of options [here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html). 

The [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/) itself is written with Quarto! Check the github repo [here](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web) to get some inspiration.

### Customization

With a bit of .css magic you can customize almost everything! Why not put a spinning raccoon in the middle of a serious text?

<div style="text-align: center">
<style> 
.rotate {
  animation: rotation 2s infinite linear;
  opacity: 1
  display: block;
}

@keyframes rotation {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(359deg);
  }
}
</style>

<img src=resources/image.jpg width=100 class="rotate">
</div>

### Multilanguage

By default, QuartoDocBuilder uses the `julia` engine provided by [QuartoNotebookRunner.jl](https://github.com/PumasAI/QuartoNotebookRunner.jl/), but you can use Jupyter and be able to run R and Python code along with Julia in the same document!
